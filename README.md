This was inspired from reading Feynman's book on QED. he explains various optical phenomena by using a spinning vector to denote phase.

In this ,phase of the lines near the middle of the mirror reinforce themselves but the edge of the mirror the phases are random and canvcel each other out. 

This explains law of reflection (i=r)
